// Small pages: GitHub rejects a whole page with "Something went wrong while executing
// your query" once that page carries too much work. With bodyText and

// and the full 71 failed every time (2026-10-22). Pages of 25 leave headroom as the list
// grows, and a page GitHub still rejects is retried at half the size.
//
// Doubted empty answers: the same search sometimes answers `issueCount: 0, nodes: []`
// with no error. Believed as-is, that blanks a list silently. So an empty first page is
// asked again before it is believed, an empty later page (after GitHub said there was
// more) is an error, and a list that had results is believed empty only once a second
// fetch agrees (createLiveSearch).
